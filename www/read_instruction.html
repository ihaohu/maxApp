            <p>You are here today to participate in a study during which we will evaluate your current knowledge and skills regarding the management of patients with certain traumatic injuries.</p>
            <p>We will present you a total of four cases studies that will focus on dealing with specific traumatic injuries.</p>
            <p>For each case, I will ask you to fist describe:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>The structures that you suspect might be injured</li>
                <li>The physical findings you would specifically look for</li>
                <li>The need for any additional studies and treatments</li>
                <li>The need for surgical intervention</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will then transition to the patient being in the operating room and I will ask you to:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Describe how you would position and prep the patient for surgery</li>
                <li>Mark the key landmarks for your incision</li>
                <li>Perform the indicated procedure using the available instruments</li>
                <li>As you perform each procedure you will be asked to speak out loud, describing the steps as you perform them</li>
                <li>It is not necessary to rush through the procedure</li>
                <li>Once you start the procedure, I will try not to interrupt you</li>
                <li>Perform the procedure as you would with a real patient to allow accurate assessment of your surgical technique</li>
                <li>You will have 20 minutes to complete each indicated procedure. Time will begin at your first incision</li>
            </ol>
